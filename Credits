	Privtool Beta Release	@(#)Credits	1.4 6/11/96
	-----------------------------------------------------

I've written most of the Privtool code by myself (mark@unicorn.com),
however an increasing number of people have donated patches, and some
people's code has been included from other software that is either
released under the GPL or otherwise freely distributable. Credit is
given in the appropriate source files, but here's the complete list
of contributors so far, in alphabetical order. Thanks to everyone for
helping to improve this software, and apologies to anyone I've missed
out!
