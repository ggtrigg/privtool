	Privtool Beta Release
	---------------------

Privtool ("Privacy Tool") is intended to be a PGP-aware replacement 
for the standard Sun Workstation mailtool program, with a similar user 
interface and automagick support for PGP-signing and PGP-encryption. Just 
to make things clear, I have written this program from scratch, it is
*not* a modified mailtool (and I hope that the Sun program code is much 
cleaner than mine 8-) !). 

Compilation
-----------

Privtool uses a configure script to produce a Makefile and config.h which
will then compile a privtool that has the options you desire. The configure
options which determine how privtool is compiled are described below.

The basic process for compilation is:

    configure <configure options>
    make
    su
    make install

Configure Options
-----------------

Running "configure --help" will give a summary of all the recognised
configure options. The privtool specific options are:

  --with-gtk
  --with-motif[=DIR]
  --with-xview[=DIR]
       These options specify which user interface to use. The --with-motif
       and --with-xview options can take a directory specification indicating
       the installed directory for the toolkit.

  --with-pgptools[=DIR]
  --with-pgp[=prog]
       Options to specify how privtool will perform its public key
       encryption & signing. If the pgptools library is specified its
       installed directory can also be entered. The --with-pgp option
       can be "pgp" or "gpg", if neither is specified then configure
       will try to find one or the other.

  --with-mixmaster[=DIR]
       Specify that anonymous remailing functionality is required, optionally
       indicating the installed directory of mixmaster.

  --with-mixpath=DIR
       Specify the remailers working directory. The path is not optional
       this time.

  --with-premail[=DIR]
       Specify that premail functionality is required and optionally the
       premail installed path.

  --with-xit[=DIR]
       This was an internal Motif development support tool at a place where
       I no longer work. You're not likely to see this - ignore this option.

  --enable-floppy=FLOPPY_DEV
       Enable support for reading key from floppy on the device FLOPPY_DEV.

  --enable-xmailer
       Specify that the X-mailer header line is inserted in outgoing mail
       headers.

  --enable-safemode
       Enable safe mode. (Keeps a copy of your mail file when saving.)

  --enable-mailspool=DIR
       Specify the mail spool directory (if necessary). Privtool will
       use /var/spool/mail as a default but on systems which use a different
       mail spool directory this can be used. Also note that individual
       privtool users can specify their mail spool file using the
       properties window (in Gtk only) or using the MAIL environment.

  --enable-audio
       Specify use of /dev/audio for random byte source.

  --enable-random
       Specify use of /dev/random for random byte source. This will be
       automatically searched for.

  --with-x
       Use the X Window System, specifying one of the first three options
       implies this.

  --with-gtk-prefix=PFX
       Prefix where GTK is installed (optional).

  --with-gtk-exec-prefix=PFX
       Exec prefix where GTK is installed (optional).

  --disable-gtktest
       Do not try to compile and run a test GTK program.

Installing Privtool
-------------------

The make install target is specific to the Gtk version at the moment. This
version of privtool is a stand-alone executable and a minimum install
would be to simply move this executable to a bin directory somewhere.
The install target also installs the man page and a gtkrc file which
reflects my personal preferences for colours and fonts.

Running Privtool
----------------

Just run it! Seriously, the user guide for the Motif and Gtk versions
can be found in the doc_motif & doc_gtk directories. User instructions
for the XView version are in README.orig.
