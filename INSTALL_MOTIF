In this tar file there is:

   privtool - the executable
Privtool.ad - the resource file
      *.xpm - various pixmaps

privtool (the executable) should go somewhere in your path. (/usr/local/bin
most likely).

Privtool.ad should go somewhere in your XFILESEARCHPATH. If you don't have
one then put this in /usr/local/app-defaults and setenv XFILESEARCHPATH
to /usr/local/%T/%N.ad.

The pixmaps should be put somewhere in your XBMLANGPATH. If you don't
have one then put them in /usr/local/bitmaps and setenv XBMLANGPATH to
/usr/local/bitmaps/%B.
