To build the Motif version of privtool you will need to get the
Xbae widget set (XbaeCaption & XbaeMatrix widgets). Privtool only uses
the Caption widget from this library.
This library is available from:
	http://shadow.apana.org.au/~lister

Once the Xbae library & includes are installed edit the Makefile.motif
to taste and type:
	make -f Makefile.motif

To install privtool type:
	make -f Makefile.motif install

The files installed and their default locations are:

    privtool - /usr/local/bin
 Privtool.ad - /usr/local/app-defaults
       *.xpm - /usr/local/icons

The makefile is set up to install the binary with a group ownership of
"mail" and g+s permission. This is how some Linux installations want
mil readers installed.

You will need to make sure that you have /usr/local/app-defaults/%N.ad
in your XFILESEARCHPATH environment variable and /usr/local/icons/%B
in your XBMLANGPATH environment variable.
(and have /usr/local/bin in your path of course! :-)

I am working on an autoconf script to make the business of compiling
and installing privtool easier, now that there are so many options
to worry about. (Motif/XView, pgptools/none, remailer/none etc.)
