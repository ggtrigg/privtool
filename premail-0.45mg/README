This is the Halloween Eve release of premail, version 0.45.

This is the first release. It is expected that the only changes
between this and the production release will be bug fixes.

If you do find a bug, or even something unclear in the documentation,
please let me know.

The documentation is in doc-0.45.html, doc-0.45.txt, or on the Web at:
