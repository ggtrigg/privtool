#
# To change a setting, remove the # before the $config, and edit the
# value after the = sign. For example, to set pgppath to
# ~/remailerkeys, change the line
#    # $config{'pgppath'} = '~/.pgp'
# to
#    $config{'pgppath'} = '~/remailerkeys'

# pgp: this is the filename where your copy of PGP resides.
#
# $config{'pgp'} = 'pgp';

# sendmail: this is where the system's real sendmail is kept. It is
# almost always /usr/lib/sendmail, but if not, set it here. If you're
# installing premail as /usr/lib/sendmail, then it's a better idea to
# set it within the premail file itself, so that it doesn't depend on
# reading this ~/.premailrc file. Also, if you're installing premail
# as /usr/lib/sendmail, then make sure that none of the ~/.premailrc
# files have config{'sendmail'} set to premail -- this will cause a
# nasty loop. 
#
# $config{'sendmail'} = '/usr/lib/sendmail';

# mixmaster: this is the filename where your mixmaster exectuable
# resides.
#
# $config{'mixmaster'} = 'mixmaster';

# movemail: this is the filename where your movemail exectuable
# resides. You only need to set this if you will be using mixmaster.
#
# $config{'movemail'} = 'movemail';

# ripem: this is the filename where your ripem exectuable resides.
# You only need to set this if you will be using S/MIME.
#
# $config{'ripem'} = 'ripem';

# moss: this is the directory where your TIS/MOSS exectuables reside.
# You only need to set this if you will be using MOSS.
#
# $config{'mossbin'} = '';

# post: full pathname of the MH posting agent. This is used in the
# -post mode.
#
# $config{'post'} = '/usr/lib/mh/post';

# geturl: A command for getting files from the Web. If you are behind
# a firewall which doesn't let you make connections to the outside,
# set this to "lynx -source". If this isn't set, premail will use its
# built-in Web client.
#
# $config{'geturl'} = '';

# dead-letter: The filename where premail stores its undeliverable
# mail.
#
# $config{'dead-letter'} = '~/dead.letter';

# logfile: where to keep a log of mail sent through premail. A log can
# be very useful in tracking down problems, especially since it can
# help identify bounced mail.
#
# $config{'logfile'} = '';

# storefile: where to store outgoing mail instead of using sendmail to
# send it directly. This is useful if your machine is usually not
# connected to the net when you use premail. You can send your mail
# later by just running csh on it (i.e. 'csh storefile'). Delete the
# file after it is sent, so that you don't send the same mail more
# than once. This is also useful for composing mail on a different
# machine than sending it, in which case you would transfer the file.
#
# $config{'storefile'} = '';

# tmpdir: The directory where premail stores its temporary files. If
# you have a ramdisk or an encrypted partition, it would be much safer
# to set tmpdir to store the temporary files there, instead. See also
# premail-secrets.
#
# $config{'tmpdir'} = '/tmp';

# charset: The default charset for outgoing 8-bit messages. If your
# mailer is correctly configured, it will label the correct charset
# itself. This is just the one used when that doesn't happen.
#
# $config{'charset'} = 'iso-8859-1';

# encrypt: Set this to 'yes' if you want to use PGP encryption, or to
# '' to disable encryption.
#
# $config{'encrypt'} = 'yes';

# ack: Set this to 'yes' to get an acknowledgement for all mail
# outgoing mail sent through the nymservers.
#
# $config{'ack'} = '';

# extrablank: insert extra blank line between header and body. This
# can be useful when the mailer messes up the message formats. Set to
# 'yes' to add the extra blank line, or get the mailer fixed ;-)
#
# $config{'extrablank'} = '';

# debug: you can set debug options here, although it is usually better
# to do so from the command line (i.e. premail +debug=y -t).
#
# $config{'debug'} = '';

# signuser: Set this to your PGP key user id if you want premail to
# sign your PGP-encrypted  messages. In general, you will want to
# store your passphrase in the secrets file for this to be useful.
#
# $config{'signuser'} = '';

# default-reply-to: This automatically adds a 'Reply-To:' field to all
# anonymous outgoing mail. You can override it by providing your own
# 'Reply-To:'. If you want to remain anonymous, set this to your
# anonymous address.
#
# $config{'anon-from'} = '';

# addresses: The location of your address book. Each entry in the
# address book has the form:
#    address: expansion
# where the expansion can either be a double-paren command, or a list
# of addresses, possibly containing double-paren commands of their
# own.
#
# $config{'addresses'} = '~/.premail/addresses';

# rlist: The file where premail stores the remailer list.
#
# $config{'rlist'} = '~/.premail/rlist';

# pubring: The file where premail stores the public keyring for the
# remailers. This file is kept separately from your normal keyring, so
# keys between the two can never get confused.
#
# $config{'pubring'} = '~/.premail/pubring.pgp';

# premail-secrets-pgp: The file where premail stores the encrypted
# secrets file.
#
# $config{'premail-secrets-pgp'} = '~/.premail/secrets.pgp';

# premail-secrets: The location of your secrets file. As with tmpfile,
# if you have a ramdisk or encrypted partition, the file should be on
# that. If the filename contains '$<', then that is expanded to your
# numeric user id.
#
# $config{'premail-secrets'} = '/tmp/.premail-secrets.$<';

# rlist-valid: The validity period for remailer-list information, in
# seconds. If the remailer-list file is older than this, it is fetched
# from the Net.
#
# $config{'rlist-valid'} = 300;

# URL's for information about the remailers. If these URL's are set to
# blank, then that disables the process of getting the files from the
# Web.
#
# $config{'rlist-url'} = 'http://kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu/rlist';
# $config{'pubring-url'} = 'http://kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu/pubring.pgp';
# $config{'type2-list-url'} = 'http://www.jpunix.com/type2.html';
# $config{'pubring-mix-url'} = 'http://www.jpunix.com/pubring.html';

# The following obscure options are only documented here, i.e. not in
# the official documentation.

# defaultpath: default chain for routing mail messages. If most or all
# of your mail will go through the remailers, then this is a good one
# to set. It can be either a standard remailer path (such as
# replay;portal;exon), or a number indicating how many hops. If you
# set this and want to send mail that is _not_ sent through the
# remailers, include the line 
#    Chain: ;
# in your header.
#
# $config{'defaultpath'} = '';

# pgp-only: choose only PGP-capable remailers in auto-chaining mode.
# Set to 'yes' to disallow non-PGP-capable remailers from being used.
# This feature isn't very useful, because premail almost always
# selects pgp-capable remailers anyway.
#
# $config{'pgp-only'} = '';

# numshuf: amount of shuffling to do when choosing a chain of
# remailers. 0 is no shuffling, 3 tends to pick remailers from the top
# of the list, and 100 should pick remailers completely at random.
#
# $config{'numshuf'} = 3;

# no-middle: disable selection of middleman remailers. This is a
# useful feature when the middleman remailers are themselves using
# premail to select chains - it prevents mail loops.
#
# $config{'no-middle'} = '';
