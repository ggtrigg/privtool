<A HREF="compose.jpg"><IMG SRC="compose_mini.gif" ALT="Compose window (small)" ALIGN=left></A>
<TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=top>The compose window is shown when one of the <STRONG>compose</STRONG> menu items is selected. The window allows you to fill out the header lines (as specified in your <TT>.privrc</TT>), select signing &amp; encryption etc. options and write your message (of course).
<P>
Multiple compose windows can be open at any time.
<P>
When selecting one of the <STRONG>Reply</STRONG> menu items which specifies "(include)" will cause the currently displayed message to be inserted in the message indented with the <EM>indent string</EM> specified in your <TT>.privrc</TT> (or "<TT>&gt; </TT>" otherwise).
<TR><TD ALIGN=right VALIGN=top><U>Including files</U>
<TD>Arbitrary files can be included by clicking on the <STRONG>Insert...</STRONG> button. This will show a filer which enables you to select a file to insert into the message.
<TR><TD ALIGN=right VALIGN=top><U>Including messages</U>
<TD>Any message can be included into the message area of a compose window. To achieve this simply select the message you want included from the message list (which becomes a primary selection) and paste it into the compose_message area by clicking the middle button (the default action for pasting a primary selection).
<P>
It is also possible to drag the message from the message list and drop it into the compose_message area.

<P>
<A HREF="folderb.jpg"><IMG SRC="folderb_mini.gif" ALT="Folder browser (small)" ALIGN=left></A>
<TD>Selecting <STRONG>Folders</STRONG> from the <STRONG>View</STRONG> menu will cause a folder browser to be displayed. This allows a hierarchical structure of mail folders to be browsed and a current folder to be specified for loading, copying or moving mail into.
<P>
In addition to the Folder Browser, the combobox in the toolbar contains the list of commonly accessed mail folders as specified in the <TT>.privrc</TT> file.
<P>
When a folder is clicked on in the Folder Browser, the folder name is inserted into the combobox and that folder becomes the <EM>current folder</EM>. Also any name can be typed in the combobox to allow messages to be saved to an arbitrary file.
<TR><TD ALIGN=right VALIGN=top><U>Loading folders</U>
<TD>When there is a current folder specified, selecting <STRONG>Load folder</STRONG> from the <STRONG>Folder</STRONG> menu will cause the current folder to be loaded, replacing the currently displayed messages with the contents of that folder.
<P>
An alternate method is to double click on the folder icon in the Folder Browser.
<TR><TD ALIGN=right VALIGN=top><U>Saving to a folder</U>
<TD>Selecting <STRONG>Copy to folder</STRONG> or <STRONG>Move to folder</STRONG> from the <STRONG>Folder</STRONG> menu will cause the currently selected message(s) to be saved to the current folder. If move was selected then the original messages will be deleted as well.
